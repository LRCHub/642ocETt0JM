Mid-twenties, feelin' sixteen
Couldn't keep our hands
to ourselves
Five minutes and you missed me
Trippin' off of how hard we fell
We were flyin' in the moment
But now
somethin' feels different
We were floatin' in an ocean
Now it's just heavy liftin'
It went from me to us to
what I swore was love
At least a couple months ago
Now the bed is getting cold
It's tough, but I'm not done,
don't wanna give it up yet
I won't let you go
I just gotta know
Tell me that you want this
Is your heart still pumpin'?
I've been gettin' nothin'
from you while I give a hundred
Tell me, are you listenin'?
Mean it when you kiss me
I'm way more than halfway there,
but something's missin'
Mm, give me a little,
meet in the middle
Show me you're with me
I just need fifty-fifty
Right now,
it'd be the right time
If you've got more to offer
'Cause I'm looking
for a lifeline
Keep our heads above water
Feels like we're drownin' now
We're the only people
who can pull us out
I don't mind lookin' like a fool
for you
So, baby, don't let me down,
let me down, no
I don't wanna cut you loose,
I'll sink for you
As long as you're still mine
Just say it one more time
Tell me that you want this
Is your heart still pumpin'?
I've been gettin' nothin'
from you while I give a hundred
Tell me, are you listenin'?
Mean it when you kiss me
I'm way more than halfway there,
but something's missin'
Mm, give me a little,
meet in the middle
Show me you're with me
I just need fifty-fifty
(I just need fifty-fifty)
One day,
if we make it the whole way
We'll need more than just okay
I need more than just halfway
But tonight,
all I need is your blue eyes
Looking at me with new life
That we're both on the same page
Tell me that you want this
Is your heart still pumpin'?
I've been gettin' nothin'
from you while I give a hundred
Tell me, are you listenin'?
Mean it when you kiss me
I'm way more than halfway there,
but something's missin'
Mm, give me a little,
meet in the middle
Show me you're with me
If we're gonna make it,
why are you waitin'?
Show me you're with me
I just need fifty-fifty
